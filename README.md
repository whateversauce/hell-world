Hello world for the lazy :)

Hey there, my name is Dave, welcome to my github page. A little about me, as you can see from my info, I started at the help desk then became an AV tech, then a network technician. Then I took a few years off from IT and earned a graduate degree in history and a couple of bachelor's degrees. Now I'm trying to get back into information security and since I don't just want to be a skid, I want to learn how to code.

I'm interested in learning about the following languages, and plan on open sourcing all of the software that I develop and sharing through git. Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Ruby, Go, Ruby-on-rails, and C.
